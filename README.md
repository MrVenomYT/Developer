# Moderation Bot




## Prerequisites
- Know how to use JavaScript, Discord.js, and Node.js




## Further Notes
- **Channels and roles are publically available through the API**
  - Used to provide more user-friendly select options
  - This is to also to avoid rate limiting
- **Everything within the /src folder is public**
  - Keep the API, Server, and bot isolated to avoid extra bundle size, or your bot tokens being bundled on the client side (not good)
  - Just avoid associating any tokens or secrets with the webapp itself
  - This also applies to the bot
- **If renaming config files, make sure to .gitignore them**
 - This is done by default, but I've made this mistake many times
